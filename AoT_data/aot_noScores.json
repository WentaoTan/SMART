Therefore, \u2220ECO = 90\u00b0.\nStep 2, Since \u2220CDB = 20\u00b0, we can use the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180\u00b0 to find \u2220CEO. In triangle CEO, \u2220CEO + \u2220ECO + \u2220CDB = 180\u00b0. Substituting the known values, we get \u2220CEO + 90\u00b0 + 20\u00b0 = 180\u00b0. Solving for \u2220CEO, we get \u2220CEO = 180\u00b0 - 110\u00b0 = 70\u00b0.\nStep 3, Since \u2220CEO is an exterior angle of triangle CDE, we can use the property that the exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the two opposite interior angles. Therefore, \u2220E = \u2220CEO - \u2220CDE = 70\u00b0 - 20\u00b0 = 50\u00b0.\nStep 4, Therefore, the measure of \u2220E is 50\u00b0. So, the correct answer is (A) 50\u00b0."

This means that after the rotation, the triangle DEF is positioned such that one of its vertices (D or F) is at the original position of vertex A.\n\nStep 3, Calculate the angle BFE: Since the rotation is 30\u00b0, the angle between the original position of side AB and its new position (after rotation) is 30\u00b0. Since triangle ABC is equilateral, all sides are equal, and the rotation does not change the lengths of the sides. Therefore, angle BFE is the same as the angle of rotation, which is 30\u00b0.\n\nStep 4, Conclusion: Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 30\u00b0."

Solving for DE, we get DE = OD * tan(15\u00b0) = 2 * tan(15\u00b0) \u2248 0.577.\n\nStep 3, Since DE is half of the chord CD, the length of CD is twice the length of DE: CD = 2 * DE \u2248 1.154.\n\nStep 4, Check the given answer choices to find the closest match to the calculated length of CD. The closest match is (B) 1.\n\nFinal answer: The length of chord CD is approximately 1."

Let's re-examine the problem. The angle labeled with \"(4 - xe)\" should be equal to the angle labeled with \"140\", not vice versa. So the correct equation is xe = 140 - 4 = 136.\nStep 5, Solve for x: xe = 136, divide both sides by e: x = 136/e.\nStep 6, Since the question asks for the value of x, we need to find the value of e. From the given choices, we can see that the only value of e that makes x a whole number is e = 1.\nStep 7, Substitute e = 1 into the equation x = 136/e: x = 136/1 = 136.\nStep 8, Since the question asks for the value of x in order for m to be parallel to n, we need to find the value of x that makes the angle labeled with \"(4 - xe)\" equal to the angle labeled with \"140\". We have already determined that the correct equation is xe = 136.

The perimeter of the parallelogram is given by 2*(AB + AD). Given that the perimeter is 20, we can write the equation 2*(AB + AD) = 20. Solving for AB + AD, we get AB + AD = 10.\nStep 3, In triangle ABE, AB + AE is the sum of the lengths of the two sides. The length of AE is equal to the length of DE, since OE is perpendicular to BD and E is the midpoint of BD. Therefore, AB + AE = AB + DE.

Therefore, AB + DE = AB + BC.\nStep 4, The perimeter of triangle ABE is the sum of the lengths of its three sides, which is AB + AE + BE. Since AE = DE and DE + BE = BD, the perimeter of triangle ABE is AB + DE + BD. Substituting the values we have, the perimeter of triangle ABE is AB + AB + BC = 2AB + BC.\nStep 5, Since AB + AD = 10 and AD = BC, we have AB + BC = 10. Therefore, the perimeter of triangle ABE is 2AB + BC = 2(AB + BC) = 2(10) = 20.\nThe correct answer is 20."

Plugging these into the formula gives \\(x = \\frac{18}{360} \\times 2\\pi \\times 3\\).\n\nStep 5, Calculate the value of x: \\(x = \\frac{18}{360} \\times 2\\pi \\times 3 = \\frac{1}{20} \\times 2\\pi \\times 3 = \\frac{\\pi}{10} \\times 3 = \\frac{3\\pi}{10}\\).\n\nStep 6, Convert \\(\\frac{3\\pi}{10}\\) to a decimal: Using the approximation \\(\\pi \\approx 3.14\\), \\(x \\approx \\frac{3 \\times 3.14}{10} = \\frac{9.42}{10} = 0.942\\).\n\nStep 7, Compare with the given choices: The closest answer to 0.942 is (B) 2.04.\n\nFinal answer: (B) 2.04."

Therefore, \u2220A + \u2220C = 180\u00b0.\nStep 2, Given that \u2220CBE = 50\u00b0, we can find \u2220C by subtracting \u2220CBE from 180\u00b0, since \u2220CBE is an exterior angle of the triangle ABE. So, \u2220C = 180\u00b0 - 50\u00b0 = 130\u00b0.\nStep 3, In a cyclic quadrilateral, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. Therefore, \u2220AOC = 2\u2220C = 2 \u00d7 130\u00b0 = 260\u00b0.\nStep 4, However, this result is not one of the given options. It seems there might be a mistake in the question or the options provided. Revisiting the problem, it's clear that the question asks for \u2220AOC, not 2\u2220C. \nStep 5, Correcting the approach, since \u2220CBE = 50\u00b0 and \u2220CBE is an exterior angle to \u2220C in triangle ABE, \u2220CBE = \u2220C. Therefore, \u2220C = 50\u00b0.\nStep 6, Since \u2220AOC is the inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc as \u2220C in the cyclic quadrilateral ABCD, \u2220AOC = 2\u2220C = 2 \u00d7 50\u00b0 = 100\u00b0.\n\nThe final answer is (C) 100\u00b0."

When two lines are parallel, the corresponding angles formed by a transversal are equal. Therefore, \u2220CAB = \u2220C'AB.\n\nStep 3, Since \u2220CAB = \u2220C'A'B' and \u2220C'AB = \u2220CAB, we can conclude that \u2220CAB = \u2220C'A'B' = \u2220C'AB.\n\nStep 4, Therefore, triangle ABC is an isosceles triangle with AB = AC = CC'. \n\nStep 5, The angles in an isosceles triangle are equal, so \u2220ABC = \u2220ACB = 80\u00b0.\n\nStep 6, The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180\u00b0. Therefore, \u2220BAC + \u2220ABC + \u2220ACB = 180\u00b0.\n\nStep 7, Since \u2220BAC = 80\u00b0 and \u2220ABC = \u2220ACB = 80\u00b0, we can solve for \u2220BAC: 80\u00b0 + 80\u00b0 + \u2220BAC = 180\u00b0.\n\nStep 8, Simplifying the equation gives: 160\u00b0 + \u2220BAC = 180\u00b0.\n\nStep 9, Subtracting 160\u00b0 from both sides gives: \u2220BAC = 20\u00b0.\n\nStep 10, Since \u2220BAC = \u2220C'A'B' = 20\u00b0, and \u2220C'AB = \u2220CAB = 80\u00b0, we can solve for \u2220BAB': \u2220BAB' = \u2220C'AB - \u2220C'A'B'.\n\nStep 11, Substituting the values gives: \u2220BAB' = 80\u00b0 - 20\u00b0 = 60\u00b0.\n\nStep 12, Since the question asks for the value of \u2220BAB', the correct answer is 60\u00b0. \n\nHowever, this option is not listed, so the closest match is:\n\nFinal Step, The closest match to the given options is (C) 30\u00b0."

The height of the cone is 30 cm, and the radius is 40 cm. Using the Pythagorean theorem, the slant height (l) can be found as \u221a(r\u00b2 + h\u00b2) = \u221a(40\u00b2 + 30\u00b2) = \u221a(1600 + 900) = \u221a2500 = 50 cm.\n\nStep 3, Calculate the lateral surface area of the cone.

We also know that KD = 10.4 and BC = KD + DC = KD + (KD * 2) = 10.4 + (10.4 * 2) = 31.2.\nStep 4, Finally, use the Power of a Point Theorem to find JK. This time, the theorem states that for two secant lines intersecting a circle, the product of the lengths of the segments of one secant is equal to the product of the lengths of the segments of the other secant. We know that BC = 31.2 and JK = BC - KD = 31.2 - 10.4 = 20.8.\nStep 5, The answer is not in the given choices, which means there was a mistake in the calculations. Let's re-examine the calculations.\nStep 6, Re-examine the calculations: We used the Power of a Point Theorem to find KD, and then we used the theorem again to find JK. However, we should have used the theorem once to find JK directly.\nStep 7, Correct the mistake: We should have used the Power of a Point Theorem to find JK directly. The theorem states that for two secant lines intersecting a circle, the product of the lengths of the segments of one secant is equal to the product of the lengths of the segments of the other secant. We know that BC = KD + DC = KD + ("

So, \u2220B = 1/2 * \u2220BOD = 1/2 * 138\u00b0 = 69\u00b0.\nStep 3, Since \u2220B + \u2220D = 180\u00b0 and \u2220B = 69\u00b0, \u2220D = 180\u00b0 - 69\u00b0 = 111\u00b0.\nStep 4, The exterior angle \u2220DCE is equal to the difference between 180\u00b0 and \u2220D, so \u2220DCE = 180\u00b0 - 111\u00b0 = 69\u00b0.\n\nTherefore, the measure of the exterior angle \u2220DCE is 69\u00b0, which corresponds to answer choice (A) 69\u00b0."

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find AE: AE^2 = AB^2 - BE^2.\nStep 5, Since AB is the diameter of the circle, AB = 2*OB = 2*(2*sqrt(5)) = 4*sqrt(5).\nStep 6, Substituting the values, we get AE^2 = (4*sqrt(5))^2 - 2^2 = 80 - 4 = 76.\nStep 7, Taking the square root of both sides, we get AE = sqrt(76) = 2*sqrt(19).\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) 2*sqrt(19)."

Rearranging the equation, we get 6y = 128 - 21x, and dividing both sides by 6, we get y = (128 - 21x) / 6.\nStep 4, Check the answer choices: Plugging in the values of x from the answer choices (A) 1, (B) 2, (C) 3, and (D) 4, we find that the value of y is closest to 2 when x = 2.\nFinal answer: (B) 2"
